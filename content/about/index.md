I'm Jacob, a 22-year-old software developer with a passion for clean code. I strive for readability and robustness when writing code, especially with tests. I have been working in the industry for over a year, migrating payment systems with Ruby on Rails and writing RESTful APIs using Flask and PHP.

Having worked with Git since before starting university, I am well-versed in project management and version control, as well as writing documentation for code using Markdown.

In my spare time, I love to experiment with Linux, which transfers well into my professional life.

Coding has been my passion for as long as I can remember.


## Computer Science Degree

I graduated from university with a first-class degree in Computer Science, finalizing my degree with my dissertation. The dissertation focused on machine learning, specifically proving which of three models is best for classifying mushrooms üçÑ.

The languages I mostly used in university were:
- Python
- C#
- C++
- MATLAB

I wrote most of my code in a Linux environment, finding it much easier than Windows.
